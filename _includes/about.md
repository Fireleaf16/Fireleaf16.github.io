# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me

I am a 2nd-Year Master Student in Robotics at **Johns Hopkins University**, passionate about Manipulation based on Robot Learning or Vision-Planning. Currently, I am working as a Robotics Engineer at **[COWAROBOT](https://www.cowarobot.com/)**, where I focus on robot teleoperation and robot learning. Previously, I was a research assistant at **[Intuitive Computing Lab](https://intuitivecomputing.github.io/)**, advised by **[Dr. Tsung-Chi Lin](https://www.lintsungchi.com/)** and **[Prof. Chien-Ming Huang](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/)**. I obtain my Bachelor Degree in Mechanical Engineering of **Pilot Class** at **Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy**. During that time, I joined **CIUS Lab** and mainly focus on Drone control and Computer Vision, advised by **[Prof. Wei Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hbaEVRMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)**.

## üî¨ Research Interests
My research focuses on the intersection of **robot manipulation, teleporation and learning**, specifically:
- **ü§ñ Robot Motion Planning and Control**: RRT, EST, A*, PID, LQR and trajectory optimization.
- **üì° Robot Teleporation**: VR based on Meta Quest3 and Vive.
- **üß† Robot learning**: Reinforcement learning, Diffusion policy and ACT.
